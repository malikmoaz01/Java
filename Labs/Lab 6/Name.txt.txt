Design an HTML form with input fields for name, email, and a submit button. 
Write JavaScript code to add event handler to the input fields for the "blur" event (i.e., onblur). When the user clicks away from an 
input field without entering valid information (e.g., a valid name or email address), display a message next to the field indicating the 
error. 
 
Instructions: 
 Use tabular format to design the HTML form. 
 You must need to use indexof() to validate an email address. Any simple solution using input type=”email” shall not 
be graded
